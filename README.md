### Virtual Tourist

**Virtual Tourist** allows users to specify travel locations around the world, and create virtual photo albums for each location. The locations and photo albums are stored in Core Data.

Users chose location on the map by dropping pins and when the pin is tapped a photo album is created with images from Flickr for that location. Users can delete photos from that album, or reload a new set of photos from Flickr.

It showcases how to use **CoreData** to persist data. It also uses **web APIs** and diplay photos in a collection view. Using **CoreData** is a core skill. This can help others learn this.
